1. Data Loading and Cleaning
Task 1.1: Loaded train.csv (sales data) and store.csv (store attributes).
Task 1.2: Merged datasets on the Store identifier.
Task 1.3: Converted Date to datetime and sorted data by date.
Task 1.4: Handled missing values (e.g., filling missing CompetitionDistance and promotion information).
Task 1.5: Converted categorical columns like StateHoliday, StoreType, and Assortment to appropriate types.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2.1 Univariate Analysis
Task 2.1.1: Visualized the distribution of Sales and Customers using histograms.

2.2 Bivariate Analysis
Task 2.2.1: Plotted Sales vs Customers using a scatter plot.
Task 2.2.2: Analyzed the effect of promotions on sales using a Sales vs Promo box plot.
Task 2.2.3: Visualized the impact of StateHoliday on sales using a box plot.

2.3 Time Series Analysis
Task 2.3.1: Resampled the data monthly and visualized monthly sales trends.

3. Time Series Decomposition
Task 3.1: Decomposed the sales time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
Task 3.2: Visualized the time series decomposition to understand cyclical patterns.

4. Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis
4.1 Correlation Analysis
Task 4.1.1: Generated a correlation matrix for numerical variables (e.g., Sales, Customers, Promo, CompetitionDistance).

4.2 Promo Effect Over Time
Task 4.2.1: Compared Promo vs Non-Promo Sales over time using a time series plot.

4.3 Store Type and Assortment Analysis
Task 4.3.1: Compared average sales across StoreType and Assortment categories.

4.4 Competition Impact
Task 4.4.1: Analyzed the effect of CompetitionDistance on sales by grouping distances into bins.

4.5 Sales Distribution by Day of Week
Task 4.5.1: Visualized average sales across different days of the week.

4.6 Seasonal Trends Across Years
Task 4.6.1: Visualized seasonal sales trends over multiple years using a heatmap.

5. Feature Engineering
Task 5.1: Added time-based features like Month and Year.
Task 5.2: Created an interaction term for Promo and SchoolHoliday (Promo_SchoolHoliday).

6. Machine Learning: Sales Forecasting
6.1 Baseline Linear Regression
Task 6.1.1: Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Task 6.1.2: Trained a baseline Linear Regression model.
Task 6.1.3: Evaluated the model using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics.

6.2 Random Forest Model
Task 6.2.1: Trained a more advanced Random Forest model.
Task 6.2.2: Evaluated the Random Forest model using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.

7. Inventory Optimization Calculations

7.1 Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
Task 7.1.1: Calculated the EOQ using the average sales demand and cost parameters.

7.2 Safety Stock and Reorder Point (ROP)
Task 7.2.1: Calculated Safety Stock to ensure product availability during variable demand.
Task 7.2.2: Calculated the Reorder Point (ROP) based on demand and lead time.

8. Reporting and Visualization
8.1 Visualizing Sales Forecast vs Actual Sales
Task 8.1.1: Visualized Actual vs Predicted Sales using a plot comparing Random Forest model predictions against actual sales data.
