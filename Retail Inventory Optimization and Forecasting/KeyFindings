Key Findings

Data Quality and Structure:
Missing values in CompetitionDistance and promotional information were handled by filling or appropriate imputation.
Data was successfully cleaned and structured for analysis.

Sales Distribution and Trends:
Sales Distribution: Sales data is skewed with a significant number of transactions clustered around lower sales values.

Monthly Trends: Sales exhibit clear seasonal patterns, with peaks during certain months (e.g., holidays and special promotions).
Impact of Promotions and Holidays:

Promotions: Sales during promotional periods were significantly higher compared to non-promotional periods.

Holidays: StateHoliday and SchoolHoliday had a notable impact on sales, with increased sales during holidays.

Competition Impact:
Competition Distance: Sales were negatively impacted by the proximity of competitors. Shorter competition distances correlated with lower sales.

Store Attributes:
Store Type and Assortment: Different store types and assortments had varying impacts on sales. Stores with more extensive assortments generally achieved higher sales.

Time Series Decomposition:

Trend Component: Sales exhibited a long-term increasing trend over the years.

Seasonal Component: Seasonal effects were prominent, with specific times of the year showing predictable patterns of higher or lower sales.

Residual Component: The residuals indicated periods of sales performance that deviated from the trend and seasonal expectations, often influenced by external factors like promotions and holidays.

Model Performance:
Linear Regression: Provided a baseline with moderate performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R-squared).
Random Forest: Improved performance over linear regression, capturing non-linear relationships and interactions more effectively.

Inventory Optimization:
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): Suggested optimal order quantities to minimize inventory costs while meeting demand.

Safety Stock: Calculated safety stock levels to ensure adequate inventory during demand fluctuations.
Reorder Point (ROP): Determined reorder points to trigger inventory restocking, minimizing stockouts and excess inventory.

Sales Forecasting:
Actual vs Predicted Sales: Random Forest model predictions closely matched actual sales, indicating effective forecasting capability.
