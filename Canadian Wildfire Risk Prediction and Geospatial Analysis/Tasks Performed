1. Data Preparation and Cleaning
Loaded the dataset and checked for inconsistencies.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data, handling missing values and formatting dates.
Feature engineering to add and refine attributes like Fire_Occurrence.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Calculated summary stats for fire size and duration.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed relationships between variables.

Visual Explorations:
Scatter Plots: Examined fire size trends by day, month, year, and location.

Box Plots: Visualized fire sizes by primary and secondary causes.

Bar Plots: Assessed the number and size of fires by cause, month, and region.

Heatmaps: Created density maps to identify fire hotspots.

Clustering and Spatial Analysis:
Applied K-Means clustering on geospatial data.
Mapped fire incidents and visualized clusters.

Temporal Analysis:
Plotted the number of fires and fire sizes over time.
Decomposed time series into trend and seasonality.

Fire Size Distribution:
Categorized fires into size groups.
Analyzed fire duration distribution.

Causal Analysis: Investigated primary and secondary fire causes and their seasonal variations.

3. Advanced Analysis
Fire Duration Analysis: Examined typical fire lifespans and anomalies.
Clustering and Density Analysis: Used clustering and density mapping for spatial pattern insights.

4. Modeling with Random Forest
Model Setup: Selected and prepared features for modeling.
Model Training: Trained a Random Forest classifier.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and adjusted thresholds.
Feature Importance: Identified key features influencing fire occurrences.
Precision-Recall Trade-off: Analyzed optimal threshold settings for balanced performance.

5. Visualization of Model Results
Plotted precision-recall curves.
Visualized feature importances.
