1. Data Preparation and Cleaning
Data Quality: The dataset required cleaning for missing values and correct date formatting.
Feature Engineering: Derived new features like Fire_Occurrence to enhance analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics:
Most fires are small in size.
The mean fire duration is short, with some outliers indicating long-lasting fires.
Correlation Analysis:
Moderate correlation between fire size and certain variables like location and date.
Visual Explorations:
Seasonal Trends: Higher fire occurrences and sizes in summer months (June, July, August).
Geographical Distribution: Concentration of fires in specific regions, particularly the Midwest and West.
Box Plots:
Fires caused by natural factors (e.g., lightning) tend to be larger.
Bar Plots:
Human activities are the most common cause of fires.
Significant regional variation in both fire occurrences and average fire size.
Heatmaps:
Identified fire hotspots in specific geographical areas.
Clustering and Spatial Analysis:
Clusters revealed distinct spatial patterns, with certain clusters more prone to large fires.
Temporal Analysis:
Increasing trend in the number of fires over the decades, peaking in the 1980s and 1990s.
Consistent seasonality with a peak in summer months.
Fire Size Distribution:
Most fires are categorized as small; very few are large or very large.
Causal Analysis:
Human causes dominate in number, while natural causes (e.g., lightning) result in larger fires on average.

3. Advanced Analysis
Fire Duration Analysis:
Majority of fires have short durations, but a few last much longer, indicating potential data quality issues or extreme conditions.
Clustering and Density Analysis:
Spatial clusters correlate with regions of high fire density, revealing geographic patterns in fire occurrences.

4. Modeling with Random Forest
Model Performance:
Random Forest achieved high accuracy (~95%).
Precision-recall trade-off showed that adjusting the threshold improved model balance.
Feature Importance:
Top Features: Year, Longitude, Latitude, and Day were the most influential features in predicting fire occurrences.
Threshold Adjustment:
Adjusting the decision threshold to 0.4 improved recall for smaller fire occurrences while maintaining overall accuracy.

5. Visualization of Model Results
Precision-Recall Trade-off:
Showed the impact of varying thresholds on model performance, helping to balance between false positives and negatives.
Feature Importances:
Highlighted the importance of temporal and spatial features, confirming the influence of seasonality and location on fire occurrences.
