Business Recommendations Based on Findings:

Target High-Value Customers (Cluster 1):
Create premium offers and loyalty programs for high spenders, especially around wines and meat products.

Re-Engage Dormant Customers:
Focus on Dormant customers with targeted campaigns to bring them back, especially offering discounts on store purchases since that is the preferred channel.

Optimize Campaign Strategies:
Prioritize the successful elements of Campaign 3 and Campaign 5 for future marketing efforts, potentially incorporating web-based incentives as web shoppers seem more engaged.

Improve Customer Service for High-Income Customers:
Since higher spenders are more likely to complain, invest in better customer service or personalized communication to improve their experience and build loyalty.

Promote Less Popular Product Categories:
Increase promotions around sweet products and fish products to balance customer spending across categories and potentially increase total spend.
