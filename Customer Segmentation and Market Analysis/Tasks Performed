Summary of the Project:
Here’s what I accomplished in the project, demonstrating a comprehensive skill set in data analysis, clustering, and campaign effectiveness:

1. Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values: Filled missing values for Income using the median.
Outlier detection: Identified and removed outliers in Income and Year_Birth.
Feature engineering: Created new features such as TotalSpending and Age to enhance analysis.

2. Customer Demographics Analysis:

Age, income, education, and marital status distribution: Visualized customer demographics to understand the dataset better.
Household structure: Analyzed family size by combining Kidhome and Teenhome.

3. Customer Segmentation:

Recency of purchases: Segmented customers into "Active", "Recent", "Inactive", and "Dormant" based on their most recent purchase.
Spending behavior analysis: Examined customer spending across product categories like wine, meat, and sweets.

4. Campaign Effectiveness:

Response rates: Analyzed the success rates of different marketing campaigns.
Customer engagement: Compared purchase behavior (web, store, catalog) between those who accepted campaigns and those who didn’t.

5. Revenue and Cost Efficiency:

Analyzed the revenue generated by customers who accepted campaigns and compared it to the cost of customer contact.

6. Purchase Channels:

Explored customer preferences across different purchasing channels (web, store, catalog).

7. Complaints Analysis:

Investigated whether complaints were related to spending behavior and income.

8. Clustering Based on Spending Behavior:

K-Means Clustering: Segmented customers into 3 clusters based on their spending patterns across product categories.
Silhouette Score: Achieved a score of 0.459, indicating moderately good separation between customer segments.
