List of Tasks Performed:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Handled missing values and outliers.
Merged date and time fields into a single datetime column.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed transaction patterns over time and by category.
Investigated customer demographics and behaviors for fraud indicators.
Explored geographical and merchant data to identify high-risk regions.

3. Feature Engineering
Created new features related to customer behavior and merchant risk.
Developed temporal features to enhance the dataset's predictive power.

4. Machine Learning for Fraud Detection
Built and evaluated a Random Forest Classifier for fraud detection.
Addressed class imbalance with class weight adjustments.
Tuned decision thresholds to improve model sensitivity to fraud.

5. Model Optimization and Recommendations
Optimized the Random Forest model for higher accuracy.
Suggested advanced techniques for handling imbalanced data.
Recommended further feature engineering to improve fraud detection.
